# 🛡️ CloudSentinel

**Cloud-based SIEM/SOAR platform that ingests AWS security events, detects threats using custom rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, triages alerts with an AI agent, and automates incident response in real time.**

CloudSentinel monitors AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and VPC Flow Logs, runs events through 8 custom detection rules, assesses severity using a stateful GPT-4o-mini triage agent that tracks actor history, and executes automated containment actions, all within seconds of the initial event.

## Detection Rules

| Rule | Description | MITRE ATT&CK | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brute Force Login | Detects 5+ failed ConsoleLogin attempts within 10 minutes | T1110 — Brute Force | HIGH |
| Root Account Usage | Flags any API call or login from the root account | T1078.004 — Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts | CRITICAL |
| IAM Privilege Escalation | Detects AttachUserPolicy, PutRolePolicy, CreateAccessKey, AddUserToGroup by non-admin users | T1548 — Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism | HIGH |
| S3 Bucket Enumeration | Detects 10+ ListBuckets/GetBucketAcl calls within 5 minutes | T1530 — Data from Cloud Storage | MEDIUM |
| Security Group Modification | Detects opening of sensitive ports (22, 3389, 3306, 445, 5432) to 0.0.0.0/0 | T1562.007 — Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall | HIGH |
| Impossible Travel | Detects same IAM user authenticating from different IPs within 1 hour | T1078 — Valid Accounts | HIGH |
| New IP Access Key Usage | Detects access key usage from a previously unseen IP address | T1078.004 — Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts | MEDIUM |
| Network Scanning | Detects 20+ rejected connections across 5+ ports within 5 minutes from VPC Flow Logs | T1046 — Network Service Scanning | MEDIUM |

---

## Automated Response Actions

| Action | Trigger | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| IAM Access Key Revocation | Brute force, impossible travel, IAM escalation, new IP usage, S3 enumeration | Lists all active access keys for the compromised user and sets them to Inactive |
| EC2 Network Isolation | Network scanning | Creates a deny-all security group and replaces the instance's security groups, cutting all inbound and outbound traffic |
| SNS Alert Notification | All detections | Sends email with rule name, severity, MITRE technique, actor, source IP, description, and full AI triage output |
| DynamoDB Audit Logging | All detections and responses | Stores every alert, actor history entry, and response action with timestamps for audit trail |

---

## AI Triage Agent

CloudSentinel integrates a stateful AI triage agent powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini that:

- Receives full alert context including event type, actor, source IP, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and timestamp
- Queries DynamoDB for actor history to determine if the IP or IAM user has triggered previous alerts
- Returns a structured assessment: severity score (1-5), recommended action (isolate/revoke_keys/escalate/monitor/dismiss), confidence level, and reasoning
- Increases severity automatically for repeat offenders and flags escalation when an actor triggers alerts across multiple rule types
- Stores triage output alongside the alert in DynamoDB for audit and dashboard display

## Simulated Attack Scenarios

12 attack scenarios were executed against the platform, covering all 7 CloudTrail-based detection rules:

| # | Scenario | MITRE Technique | Rule Triggered | AI Severity | AI Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Root account creates access key | T1078.004 | root_account_usage | 5/5 CRITICAL | isolate |
| 2 | Junior dev attaches AdministratorAccess policy | T1548 | iam_privilege_escalation | 5/5 CRITICAL | escalate |
| 3 | Attacker enumerates S3 buckets (10 rapid calls) | T1530 | s3_enumeration | 4/5 HIGH | escalate |
| 4 | Rogue admin opens SSH and RDP to 0.0.0.0/0 | T1562.007 | security_group_modification | 5/5 CRITICAL | escalate |
| 5 | User logs in from US then Eastern Europe in minutes | T1078 | impossible_travel | 5/5 CRITICAL | isolate |
| 6 | 5 failed console logins in 10 minutes | T1110 | brute_force_login | 5/5 CRITICAL | escalate |
| 7 | Access key used from new IP address | T1078.004 | new_ip_access_key_usage | 4/5 HIGH | escalate |
| 8 | Intern creates access key for backdoor account | T1548 | iam_privilege_escalation | 5/5 CRITICAL | escalate |

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and VPC Flow Logs enabled
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4o-mini)
- Python 3.12+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate IAM permissions

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Create DynamoDB tables: `cloudsentinel-alerts`, `cloudsentinel-actor-history`, `cloudsentinel-response-log` (on-demand capacity, partition key + sort key as described in source)
3. Create SNS topic `cloudsentinel-alerts-topic` and subscribe your email
4. Deploy `lambda_function.py` with `src/` as a Lambda function (Python 3.12, 256MB, 60s timeout)
5. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a Lambda environment variable
6. Attach IAM policies: DynamoDB, SNS, IAM, EC2 full access to the Lambda execution role
7. Create an EventBridge rule on the default bus with the event pattern filtering `aws.iam`, `aws.s3`, `aws.ec2`, `aws.signin` sources
8. Configure AWS credentials locally and run the dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard/app.py`
